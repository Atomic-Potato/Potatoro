The focus of potatoro is making a pomodoro that is frictionless and not treat you like a child with ADHD (no offense to anyone). So its a simple timer but allows you to be flexible with your timers and sessions. For example, need a couple more minutes? good ahead add some time. These last 2 minutes takking too long? skip it fam. Also the theme is quite customizable, so if u wanna make it purely a solid color and u cant even read text anymore, u can and aint no one judgin'. And even if it wasnt customizable enough, make it your problem and download the sauce code, ...or send me some feet pics and i may consider adding what u want.
